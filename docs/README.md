# The non-reference docs have been moved!

The documentation for Docker Engine has been merged into
[the general documentation repo](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io).

If you'd like to edit the current published version of the Engine docs,
do it in the master branch here:
https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/tree/master/engine

If you need to document the functionality of an upcoming Engine release,
use the `vnext-engine` branch:
https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/tree/vnext-engine/engine

The reference docs have been left in docker/docker (this repo), which remains
the place to edit them.

The docs in the general repo are open-source and we appreciate
your feedback and pull requests!
