# Docker storage drivers

Docker relies on driver technology to manage the storage and interactions associated with images and they containers that run them. This section contains the following pages:

* [Understand images, containers, and storage drivers](imagesandcontainers.md)
* [Select a storage driver](selectadriver.md)
* [AUFS storage driver in practice](aufs-driver.md)
* [BTRFS storage driver in practice](btrfs-driver.md)
* [Device Mapper storage driver in practice](device-mapper-driver.md)
* [OverlayFS in practice](overlayfs-driver.md)
* [FS storage in practice](zfs-driver.md)

If you are new to Docker containers make sure you read ["Understand images, containers, and storage drivers"](imagesandcontainers.md) first. It explains key concepts and technologies that can help you when working with storage drivers.
