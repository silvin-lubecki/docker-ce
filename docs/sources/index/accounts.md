# Accounts in the Docker Index

## Docker IO and Docker Index Accounts

You can `search` for Docker images and `pull` them from the [Docker Index](
https://index.docker.io) without signing in or even having an account. However,
in order to `push` images, leave comments or to *star* a repository, you are going
to need a [Docker IO](https://www.docker.io) account.

### Registration for a Docker IO Account

You can get a Docker IO account by [signing up for one here](
https://index.docker.io/account/signup/). A valid email address is required to
register, which you will need to verify for account activation.

### Email activation process

You need to have at least one verified email address to be able to use your
Docker IO account. If you can't find the validation email, you can request
another by visiting the [Resend Email Confirmation](
https://index.docker.io/account/resend-email-confirmation/) page.

### Password reset process

If you can't access your account for some reason, you can reset your password
from the [*Password Reset*](https://www.docker.io/account/forgot-password/)
page.
