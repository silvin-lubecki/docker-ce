.. note::
    
    This example assumes you have Docker running in daemon mode. For more information please see :ref:`running_examples`

.. note::

   These examples use ``sudo`` before each ``docker`` command you could also
   add your current ``<username>`` to docker's group and get rid of ``sudo``.
   You just need to type: ``$ sudo usermod -a -G docker <username>``
