# This script looks for bundles built by make.sh, and releases them on a
# public S3 bucket.
#
# Bundles should be available for the VERSION string passed as argument.
#
# The correct way to call this script is inside a container built by the
# official Dockerfile at the root of the Docker source code. The Dockerfile,
# make.sh and release.sh should all be from the same source code revision.

To run, I need:
- to be in a container generated by the Dockerfile at the top of the Docker
  repository;
- to be provided with the name of an S3 bucket, in environment variable
  AWS_S3_BUCKET;
- to be provided with AWS credentials for this S3 bucket, in environment
  variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY;
- a generous amount of good will and nice manners.
The canonical way to run me is to run the image produced by the Dockerfile: e.g.:"

docker run -e AWS_S3_BUCKET=get-staging.docker.io \\
              AWS_ACCESS_KEY=AKI1234... \\
              AWS_SECRET_KEY=sEs3mE... \\
              f0058411

	exit 1
