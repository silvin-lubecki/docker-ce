		title = "What is a maintainer?"

		text = """
There are different types of maintainers, with different responsibilities, but
all maintainers have 3 things in common:

1) They share responsibility in the project's success.
2) They have made a long-term, recurring time investment to improve the project.
3) They spend that time doing whatever needs to be done, not necessarily what
is the most interesting or fun.

Maintainers are often under-appreciated, because their work is harder to appreciate.
It's easy to appreciate a really cool and technically advanced feature. It's harder
to appreciate the absence of bugs, the slow but steady improvement in stability,
or the reliability of a release process. But those things distinguish a good
project from a great one.

	[Rules.bdfl]

		title = "The Benevolent dictator for life (BDFL)"

		text = """
Docker follows the timeless, highly efficient and totally unfair system
known as [Benevolent dictator for
life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_Dictator_for_Life), with
yours truly, Solomon Hykes, in the role of BDFL. This means that all
decisions are made, by default, by Solomon. Since making every decision
myself would be highly un-scalable, in practice decisions are spread
across multiple maintainers.

Ideally, the BDFL role is like the Queen of England: awesome crown, but not
an actual operational role day-to-day. The real job of a BDFL is to NEVER GO AWAY.
Every other rule can change, perhaps drastically so, but the BDFL will always
be there, preserving the philosophy and principles of the project, and keeping
ultimate authority over its fate. This gives us great flexibility in experimenting
with various governance models, knowing that we can always press the "reset" button
without fear of fragmentation or deadlock. See the US congress for a counter-example.

BDFL daily routine:

* Is the project governance stuck in a deadlock or irreversibly fragmented?
	* If yes: refactor the project governance
* Are there issues or conflicts escalated by core?
	* If yes: resolve them
* Go back to polishing that crown.
"""

	[Rules.decisions]

		title = "How are decisions made?"

		text = """
Short answer: EVERYTHING IS A PULL REQUEST.

Docker is an open-source project with an open design philosophy. This
means that the repository is the source of truth for EVERY aspect of the
project, including its philosophy, design, road map, and APIs. *If it's
part of the project, it's in the repo. If it's in the repo, it's part of
the project.*

As a result, all decisions can be expressed as changes to the
repository. An implementation change is a change to the source code. An
API change is a change to the API specification. A philosophy change is
a change to the philosophy manifesto, and so on.

All decisions affecting Docker, big and small, follow the same 3 steps:

* Step 1: Open a pull request. Anyone can do this.

* Step 2: Discuss the pull request. Anyone can do this.

* Step 3: Merge or refuse the pull request. Who does this depends on the nature
of the pull request and which areas of the project it affects. See *review flow*
for details.

Because Docker is such a large and active project, it's important for everyone to know
who is responsible for deciding what. That is determined by a precise set of rules.

* For every *decision* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should *decide*.

* For every *problem* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should be responsible for *fixing* it.

* For every *question* in the project, the rules should designate, in a deterministic way,
who should be expected to have the *answer*.
"""

	[Rules.review]

		title = "Review flow"

		text = """
Pull requests should be processed according to the following flow:

* For each subsystem affected by the change, the maintainers of the subsystem must approve or refuse it.
It is the responsibility of the subsystem maintainers to process patches affecting them in a timely
manner.

* If the change affects areas of the code which are not part of a subsystem,
or if subsystem maintainers are unable to reach a timely decision, it must be approved by
the core maintainers.

* If the change affects the UI or public APIs, or if it represents a major change in architecture,
the architects must approve or refuse it.

* If the change affects the operations of the project, it must be approved or rejected by
the relevant operators.

* If the change affects the governance, philosophy, goals or principles of the project,
it must be approved by BDFL.

	[Rules.DCO]

	title = "Helping contributors with the DCO"

	text = """
The [DCO or `Sign your work`](
https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#sign-your-work)
requirement is not intended as a roadblock or speed bump.

Some Docker contributors are not as familiar with `git`, or have used a web based
editor, and thus asking them to `git commit --amend -s` is not the best way forward.

In this case, maintainers can update the commits based on clause (c) of the DCO. The
most trivial way for a contributor to allow the maintainer to do this, is to add
a DCO signature in a Pull Requests's comment, or a maintainer can simply note that
the change is sufficiently trivial that it does not substantially change the existing
contribution - i.e., a spelling change.

When you add someone's DCO, please also add your own to keep a log.

	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

	# For each release (including minor releases), a "release captain" is assigned from the
	# pool of core maintainers. Rotation is encouraged across all maintainers, to ensure
	# the release process is clear and up-to-date.
	#
	# It is common for core maintainers to "branch out" to join or start a subsystem.
