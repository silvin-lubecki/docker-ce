	[Org."Core maintainers"]

	# The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
	# can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

	# For each release (including minor releases), a "release captain" is assigned from the
	# pool of core maintainers. Rotation is encouraged across all maintainers, to ensure
	# the release process is clear and up-to-date.

	[Org.Curators]

	# The curators help ensure that incoming issues and pull requests are properly triaged and
	# that our various contribution and reviewing processes are respected. With their knowledge of
	# the repository activity, they can also guide contributors to relevant material or
	# discussions.
	#
	# They are neither code nor docs reviewers, so they are never expected to merge. They can
	# however:
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's an exact duplicate
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's inappropriate or off-topic
